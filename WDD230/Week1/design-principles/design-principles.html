        <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><img alt="HicksScreenshot" src="hicks.jpg" ></a>
        <p>Hick's Law is essentially a law that explains how a person's length of time in a decision is based upon the amount of items present.
            The less items there are, the less time it takes. The more items there are, the more time it takes. I chose amazon as an example because it embellishes both.
            While containing massive amounts of wants that could make browsing go on for hours, they also conatain a 'featured' and 'filters' to help limit selection and make decisions faster.

        <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>
        <a href="https://willyoupressthebutton.com/"><img alt="fittsScreenshot" src="fitts.jpg"></a>
        <p>Fitt's Law is pretty much the idea that the closer thew item is the more likely the person is to react with it.
            Like a bright red button in the president's office. Or even this game that literally asks if you would press the button.

        <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/home"><img alt="RoTScreenshot" src="RoT.jpg"></a>
        <p>Rule of Thirds is what it is. A design principle based on thirds. Twitter isn't the best site to showcase on mobile for thirds,
            yet on the website it has a slight example. Sometimes even offsetting items on one third while leaving the other open for a clear
            view of an image is a good use for thirds.
